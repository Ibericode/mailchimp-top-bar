MC4WP: Mailchimp Top Bar
==============

Adds a beautiful and customisable Mailchimp opt-in bar to the top of your WordPress site. 

Installation
------------

There is a [guide on how to install the plugin in your WordPress site](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-top-bar/installation/).

If you want to run the latest development version, you have two options:

* You can download the repository .zip file: [mailchimp-top-bar.zip](https://github.com/ibericode/mailchimp-top-bar/archive/master.zip)
* You can clone the GitHub repository using Git

This will download the latest development version of the Mailchimp Top Bar plugin. While this version is usually stable,
it is not recommended for use in a production environment.

Note that this plugin depends on the [Mailchimp for WordPress plugin](https://www.mc4wp.com/) to work, so you will need to install that plugin first.
